Special day, graduation.\n\n  \nNever thought I'd make it.\n\n  \nThree days grade school,\nthree days high school.\n\n  \nThose were awkward.\n\n  \nThree days college. I'm glad I took\na day and hitchhiked around the hive.\n\n  \nYou did come back different.\n\n  \n- Hi, Barry.\n- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\n\n  \n- Hear about Frankie?\n- Yeah.\n\n  \n- You going to the funeral?\n- No, I'm not going.\n\n  \nEverybody knows,\nsting someone, you die.\n\n  \nDon't waste it on a squirrel.\nSuch a hothead.\n\n  \nI guess he could have\njust gotten out of the way.\n\n  \nI love this incorporating\nan amusement park into our day.\n\n  \nThat's why we don't need vacations.\n\n  \nBoy, quite a bit of pomp...\nunder the circumstances.\n\n  \n- Well, Adam, today we are men.\n- We are!\n\n  \n- Bee-men.\n- Amen!\n\n  \nHallelujah!\n\n  \nStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,\n\n  \nplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.\n\n  \nWelcome, New Hive Oity\ngraduating class of...\n\n  \n...9:15.\n\n  \nThat concludes our ceremonies.\n\n  \nAnd begins your career\nat Honex Industries!\n\n  \nWill we pick ourjob today?\n\n  \nI heard it's just orientation.\n\n  \nHeads up!

Most bee jobs are\nsmall ones. But bees know\n\n  \nthat every small job,\nif it's done well, means a lot.\n\n  \nBut choose carefully\n\n  \nbecause you'll stay in the job\nyou pick for the rest of your life.\n\n  \nThe same job the rest of your life?\nI didn't know that.\n\n  \nWhat's the difference?\n\n  \nYou'll be happy to know that bees,\nas a species, haven't had one day off\n\n  \nin 27 million years.\n\n  \nSo you'll just work us to death?\n\n  \nWe'll sure try.\n\n  \nWow! That blew my mind!\n\n  \n\"What's the difference?\"\nHow can you say that?\n\n  \nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\n\n  \nI'm relieved. Now we only have\nto make one decision in life.\n\n  \nBut, Adam, how could they\nnever have told us that?\n\n  \nWhy would you question anything?\nWe're bees.\n\n  \nWe're the most perfectly\nfunctioning society on Earth.\n\n  \nYou ever think maybe things\nwork a little too well here?\n\n  \nLike what?

You have to be bred for that.\n\n  \nRight.\n\n  \nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n  \nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n  \nPerhaps. Unless you're wearing it\nand the ladies see you wearing it.\n\n  \nThose ladies?\nAren't they our cousins too?\n\n  \nDistant. Distant.\n\n  \nLook at these two.\n\n  \n- Oouple of Hive Harrys.\n- Let's have fun with them.\n\n  \nIt must be dangerous\nbeing a Pollen Jock.\n\n  \nYeah.
